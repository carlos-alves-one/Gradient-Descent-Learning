# Gradient-Descent-Learning

Code in Matlab that demonstrates how to implement gradient descent learning for an artificial neural network

This code assumes that X is a matrix of input data with dimensions numExamples x numInputs, and y is a vector 
of correct output values with length numExamples. The code initializes the weights and biases of the network 
to random values, and then loops over the number of epochs, updating the weights and biases on each iteration.

It is important to carefully tune the learning rate hyperparameter to ensure that the optimization
